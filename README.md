# TempTabs
Adds the ability to create temporary tabs that automatically close when switching away from them. Useful if you want to google something and don't want to have to remember to close the tab.

# Keybindings:
* \<Alt-x>          Open new temp tab
* \<Alt-Shift-x>    Make current tab temp
* \<Alt-c>          Make current tab permanent
